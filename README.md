## Instruction
# PLAYERS MANAGER
Here you have one entry box, one select box and two buttons. When you enter you friends` nicknames into entry box and press add, they will be saved to a file player.txt.
Their nicknames will also appear in select box as valid options. When you click on their nickanems in select box they will be inserted into entry box. If you click button Remove,
every player from entry box that is in you players.txt file will be removed from the file. Entry box is case insensitive so player1 and PLAYER1 are the same nickanems!

# TEAM GENERATOR
Here you have text box, select box, two entry boxes and two buttons. In select box you can choose players, clicked nickname will appear in text box. When you choose all players
that you want to play with, you can click generate button. Generated teams will appear in entry boxes. You can skip choosing players from select box and just type their nickanems into text box, this way you don`t need to save nicknames into players.txt, but you will have to type nicknames manually every time you run the app. Clear button deletes every text from textbox and two entryboxes.
